    1-What is difference between Array and ArrayList?

     Array:                                                                             ArrayList:
     *fixed size                                                                        *dynamic size
     *multidimensional form                                                             *no multidimensional format
     *store both primitive and object                                                   *Only Object
     *It doesnt have methods.(length)                                                   *it has methods(add,get,remove,replace,etc..)
     *Synthax is different -->String[] names={"ahmet","mehmet","foughali"}              *List<Integer> numbers=new ArrayList();

     2-What is difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?

     -->To be honest I do not use LinkedList in my project but as much as I know there is an execution time difference.

     -->The reaching out the elements inside of the list is more efficient and faster in Arraylists
     -->When you do any manipulation(changing,replacing,inserting,deleting,removing) at this moment LinkedList is more efficient and faster.
