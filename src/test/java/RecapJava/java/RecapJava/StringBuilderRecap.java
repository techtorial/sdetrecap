    POSSIBLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:

    1-What is the difference between String and String Builder?

    -->They are both useful for the project in terms of mutability and immutability
    -->String is immutable
    -->String builder is mutable
    -->String builder has different methods --> append,reverse...(Show off yourself -->then do it for second way)

    2-What is the difference between String Builder and String Buffer?

    -->StringBuffer and HashTable --> are synchronized --> AND SLOWER
    -->Map,List,Set,String,StringBuilder -->non-Synchronized --> AND FASTER

    NOTE:Mutable is all about giving functions/actions/manipulations without "RE-ASSIGNING"

    NOTE2:Immutability is all about giving/functions/actions/manipulations WITH "RE-ASSIGNING"

    3-What is PassByValue and PassByReference ?

    PassByValue and PassByReference is all about the way that you pass the data

    -->if you call the method and pass the value directly(stringbuilder.run("AHMET").It means you are passing by Value
    String name="Ahmet"
    -->if you call the method and pass the value with reference(stringbuilder.run(name).It means you are passing by reference
