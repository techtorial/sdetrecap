    INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:

    1-Can you tell me about map and where do you use map in your project?

    *Map is an awesome interface to be used in my project to share/store the data as KEY AND VALUE

    2-What is the connection between map and collection?

    To be honest, I would say it is a combination of collections. List refers to the VALUE of the map (value can be dublicates)
                                                                  Set refers to the KEY of the map (key needs to be unique)

    3-What is the type of map?

    HashMap-->random order
    LinkedHashMap-->insertion order
    TreeMap -->ascending order

    4-What is synchronization? can you give examples and what do you know about ?

     -->It executes any actions one by one.

     -->As you know we have two most common concepts in java -->HashTable and StringBuffer

       They are synchronized --> THREAD SAFE ************* -->
       Non synchronize --> MAP,SET,LIST --> NOT- THREAD SAFE ***********

           TIPS:You can use a method from map --> ContainsKey
           TIPS:you can use if condition
