    1-What is Object and tell me about its methods?

     -->Object is a represetantion of class(Blueprint) -->CAR,HUMAN,ANIMAL

     -->.equals()--->which is a comparison for object

     -->.toString()-->it turns the variable to the String (Arrays.toString)
       boolean condition=true;
       sout(condition.toString) -->"TRUE"

     -->HashCode()-->location of the object
       sout(array) --> 14324234adfsdgf
       sout(Arrays.toString(array)-->{1,2,3)

    2-WHat is the difference between object and class?

     Class:is a blueprint/template which you can create as many as object
     Object:is a represetantion of a class -->instance of a classs(INSTANCE=OBJECT)
     Class:Once class I can have  one sceanario(HUMAN,ANIMAL,CAR)
     Object:I can create as many scenario I want for the object (BMW,AUDI,MERCEDES BENZ)
     Class:declared with class keyword
     Object:declared with NEW keyword
    3-How do you initiliaze the instance variables?

      There are different ways of initiliazing the instance variables:

      **** -->Constructor
           -->Methods(setters)
           -->Create an object and initiliaze
           -->Directly intiliaze from instance variables

    4-What is the difference between instance and local variables ?

        INSTANCE VARIABLES:
        -->Belongs to the class
        -->as default it has values ( String-->null, int --> 0 double -->0.0 boolean -->False)
        -->Has access modifiers(private public...etc)

        LOCAL VARIABLES:
        -->Belongs to the block of code
        -->It doesn't have any default values
        -->it doesn't have access modifiers
