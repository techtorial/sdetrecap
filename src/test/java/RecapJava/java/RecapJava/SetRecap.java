    POSSIBLE INTERVIEW:

     1-How can you make the element unique with collection?

     In my project, i was using Set collection to make the elements unique to prevent duplication which causes some problems for some points.

      -->it is a way to store only unique objects(elements)
      AUTOMATION:In addition to this, time to time I need to switch my windows to do some validations in my automation.At this point
      I use "GET WINDOW HANDLES" method from driver and store it as SET<STRING>.

     2-Can you tell me the types of collections?

     We have 3 types of collections --> LIST , SET , QUE, but I never used Que in my framework, so I am not familiar with that.

     -->I am a quick learner.=

     3-Can you explain the difference between SET and LIST?

     -->Definitely, List and Set are used for storage of Objects.   But List can have duplicates, Set stores unique elements
                                                                    *** -->List is indexing, but Set is not.
                                                                   Synthax is different  --> List<String> names ,  Set<String> names;

     4-What is the difference between Set Types?

       HashSet --> it stores the element without any order(Random)
       LinkHashSet-->it stores the element with insertion order(one by one)
       TreeSet --> it stores the element with ascending order

       ALTERNATIVE FOR TREESET WITH LIST --> Collections.sort(list); (ascending order)
